This project looks at cross-linguistic word form data and builds family trees of languages based on their "optimal phylogenies." 

The Northeuralex datatset is a lexicostatistical database with words from over 20 language families. It is contructed by using orthographies or standard transcriptions to generate a unified IPA encoding. The purpose is for improving computational models of language relationships and language contact.
